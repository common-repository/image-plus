== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get started? =

In your WordPress Editor, add an **Image+** block, or transform an existing Image block into an **Image+** block. [More details](https://imageplus.ai/products/image-plus-for-wordpress/get-started-with-image-plus-for-wordpress/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=plugin).

= What are the benefits of using Image+ instead of just a plain Image? =

= Do I need to use the WordPress block editor ("Gutenberg")? =

You can continue to use your current page builder on your site.

You create your Image+ as a block; and you can do that within your page if you are using the block editor. Or you can create it from the Image+ Library which generates a shortcode to insert your Image+ into any other page builder.

If you are using the "Classic Editor" plugin, no worries, Image+ will use the Gutenberg editor for your Image+, and the Classic Editor for everything else. You can then insert an Image+ into the Classic Editor using its shortcode.
